The "Home Energy System Status Log Grabber" is a simple collection
of scripts I write to collect and process status log files from various
home energy system components.

I hope it can be useful for others, but I write it for myself in my
rare spare time. Thus, documentation is bad and even some configuration
is hardcoded.
